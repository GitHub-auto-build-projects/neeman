{"name":"Neeman","tagline":"A framework for converting a web app into a hybrid mobile app. It includes a barebones nodejs app to demonstrate some best practices to make a mobile developers job easier.","body":"<img src=\"http://intellum.github.io/neeman/images/Logo.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"64\" />\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intellum/neeman.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/intellum/neeman)\r\n\r\n##Turn a web app into a great native user experience.\r\n\r\nWeb apps just can't compete with native navigation. We can use the strengths or both though.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://intellum.github.io/neeman/images/Navigation.gif\" width=\"540\" height=\"294\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nNeeman is a [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WebKit/Reference/WKWebView_Ref/) wrapper that allows you to quickly integrate a web app into a native iOS app. When a link is tapped, another web view is pushed onto the [UINavigationController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/) stack.\r\n\r\nYou can easily hide elements that you would like to implement natively. For example, a \"hamburger menu\" can be hidden with CSS. The navigation can then be replaced by a [UITabBarController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITabBarController_Class/). You can also easily inject javascript which can call back out to your code. \r\n\r\nNeeman is designed for **native iOS developers** who would like to gain a productivity boost by using an existing web app instead of duplicating it. Neemans goal is to help you turn a web app into a native iOS app with a great user experience.\r\n\r\nIf you are a web developer you might be better served by [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). If you are a Swift developer, or would like to be, keep reading.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### CocoaPods\r\n\r\n[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo gem install cocoapods\r\n```\r\n\r\n> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build Neeman.\r\n\r\nTo integrate Neeman into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsource 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\r\nplatform :ios, '8.0'\r\nuse_frameworks!\r\n\r\npod 'Neeman'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pod install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\n###Step 1\r\nOpen your storyboard and select a UIViewController that you would like to show your web app in. Sets its class to WebViewController.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://intellum.github.io/neeman/images/Step-1.png\" width=\"260\" height=\"108\" />\r\n\r\n###Step 2\r\nDefine the URL of the page that it should show.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://intellum.github.io/neeman/images/Step-2.png\" width=\"260\" height=\"80\" />\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
